        The Field Sponsorship program is a cooperative effort between the City of Corinth, residents, local business owners, clubs, and organizations to help keep the parks, and athletic fields beautiful. Interested parties may sponsor one or more locations in Corinth.
        The Sponsor will agree to maintain or fund the maintenance of an area agreed upon by the City and the Sponsor for a one-year period.
        The Park Maintenance Division handles the mowing and upkeep of over 150 acres of park land within our city which includes 12 neighborhood parks and the Corinth Community Park.
        The Recreation Division handles working with our Co-Sponsored Associations to provide field space for league practices and games, and outside tournaments.
        activities as well as making a special effort to offer programs for the entire family, old and young alike, provide a great way to meet people, pursue a hobby, develop new skills and interests, keep mentally or physically fit, and simply to enjoy life.
